## Overview

 * Tips on the homework from the TAs
 * Review/continuation of creating confidence intervals for a proportion
 * Concepts behind a hypothesis test for a single proportion
 * Hypothesis tests for a single proportion in R





$\\$






## Part 1: Tips on future homework

The TAs had a few tips to keep in mind when submitting future homework which are:

* When a problem is computationally fast, make sure to use enough iterations in your for loop (i.e., 10,000 iterations, not 100). As a general rule of thumb, your answer shouldn't change much depending on the starting random number seed. You can get misleading estimate/plots if you have not run enough iterations.

* Make sure to use a reasonable number of histogram bins when describing a distribution's shape (e.g., nclass = 50 not 4).

* Make sure your code is not on one long line which gets cut off when you knit to a pdf, e.g., 

plot(x, y,
     xlab = "my x label",
     ylab = "my y label", 
     main = "the title of my plot")

* 1-2 paragraphs should suffice for most written answers (always < 1 page). 

* When running code interactively, there are useful R Studio features 
    - the broom to clear environment variables
    - the green down arrow to run code up to the current chunk

## Part 1: Continuation of formulas for the standard error and CIs for a proportion

For particular statistics, there are formulas that give the standard error! We can use these instead of running the bootstrap when they are available. 



$\\$




#### Part 1.1: Formula for the standard error of the mean $\bar{x}$


When our statistic of interest is the mean $\bar{x}$, the formula to compute the standard error of the mean is:


(1) $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

and an estimate for this is given by:

(2) $s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

Where:

* $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, 
* *s* is the standard deviation statistic computed from a sample of size *n* 
* *n* is the sample size. 

Note, equation 1 above is a theoretical construct since we will never know $\sigma$ (only Plato knows this) while equation 2 above is possible to calculate from a sample of data. 


Let's use formula 2 to calculate the  $s_{\bar{x}}$:


```{r part_5_1}

library(okcupiddata)

the_ages <- profiles$ages[1:20]



# calculate the mean, n, s to create the SEM




# create the confidence interval



```






$\\$






#### Part 1.2: Formula for the standard error of a proportion $\hat{p}$


When our statistic of interest is the sample proportion $\hat{p}$, the formula to compute the standard error of a proportion is:


(1) $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi (1 - \pi)}{n}}$

and an estimate for this is given by:

(2) $s_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n}}$

Where:

* $\pi$ is the population proportion 
* $\hat{p}$ is the proportion from a sample of size *n* 
* *n* is the sample size. 

Again, equation 1 above is a theoretical construct since we will never know $\pi$ (only Plato knows this) while equation 2 above can be used to calculate from a sample of data.

**Question**: If we have formulas for the standard error of these statistics, why use the bootstrap?  


**Answer:** 







$\\$







#### Part 1.3: Bootstrap for CIs for proportions


```{r bootstrap_proportion}

# get drug use behavior for first 50 OkCupid users
(type_of_drug_user_50 <- na.omit(profiles$drugs)[1:50])


# calculate the p-hat statistic for "sometimes" drug users


# create the bootstrap distribution by creating 10,000 bootstrap statistics
# through sampling with replacement



# plot a histogram of the bootstrap distribution




# calculate the 95% CI using the percentile method



# bootstrap estimate of the standard error, SE*



# calculate the CI using the formula...



# create the CI using the SE from the formula



```

## Part 2: Hypothesis tests for a single proportion


Let's start our review of hypothesis tests by examining hypothesis tests for a single proportion $\pi$



$\\$





## Part 3a: Running a randomization test for a single proportion in R




$\\$





#### Part 3.1: Is it possible to smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease? 


Joy Milne claimed to have the ability to smell whether someone had Parkinson’s disease.

To test this claim, researchers gave Joy 6 shirts that had been worn by people who had Parkinson’s disease and 6 people who did not

Joy identified 11 out of the 12 shirts correctly. 

Let's run a hypothesis test to assess whether there is significant evidence to suggest that Joy can really could smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease.




$\\$





##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words, and set up the rules of the game

**In words:** 



**Using symbols**





**Rules of the game (set the alpha level)**





$\\$





##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r joy_obs_stat}


```





$\\$





##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist}



```





$\\$




##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value}





```





$\\$





##### Step 5: Make a decision






$\\$






**Questions**

 1. Do you believe Joy can really smell Parkinson's disease? 
 
    - What about after [you read this article](https://wapo.st/2lW9GQL)? 

 2. Is it better to report the actual p-value or just whether we rejected the null hypothesis $H_0$?

## Part 3b: Do more than 25% of American's believe in ghosts? 

A telephone survey of 1000 randomly selected US adults found that 31% of them say they believe in ghosts. Does this provided evidence that more than 1 in 4 US adults believe in ghosts?  





##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words, and set up the rules of the game


**In words:** 



**Using symbols**






**Rules of the game**





$\\$




##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r ghost_obs_stat}



```





$\\$





##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_ghost}



```



$\\$




##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_ghost}





```




$\\$





##### Step 5: Make a decision
