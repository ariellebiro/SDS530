## Overview

 * Correlation
 * Permutation tests for correlation
 * Theories of hypothesis tests
 * Parametric hypothesis tests



$\\$








## Part 1: of correlation


Let's review correlation and how we could create a permutation test to see if there is a statistically significant correlation between two quantitative variables. 





$\\$







## Part 2: Permutation tests for correlation





$\\$





##### Step 0: Plot the data


```{r cereal_plot}


# get the data
# source('class_functions.R')
# download_class_data("cereal.Rda")

# load the data
load("cereal.Rda")


# create a scatter plot of carbs as a function of calories





```





$\\$







##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 


$H_0: $
$H_A: $ 


$\alpha = $



$\\$








##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic




```{r sudoku_obs_stat}



# calculate the correlation statistic

  
  

```






$\\$




##### Step 3: Create the null distribution




```{r sudoku_null_dist}


# one null distribution statistic 
cor(sample(cereal$Calories), cereal$Carbs)


# create the full null distribution 




```





$\\$







##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r sudoku_p_value}



# plot the null distribution again with a line at the observed statistic





# calculate the p-value



```


$\\$







##### Step 5: Make a decision

## Homework 5: Was the 1969 Vietnam Draft completely random?

## Part 3: Parametric tests for one mean



#### Part 3a: Parametric test for one mean - The Chips Ahoy! Challenge 


In the mid-1990s a Nabisco marking campaign claimed that there were at least 1000 chips in every bag of Chips Ahoy! cookies.

A group of Air Force cadets tested this claim by dissolving the cookies from 42 bags in water and counting the number of chips.

They found the average number of chips per bag was 1261.6, with a standard deviation of 117.6 chips 

Test whether the average number of chips per bag is greater than 1000.  Do the results confirm Nabiscoâ€™s claim?  


We will use a t-statistic here...

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} $ 




$\\$





**Part 3.1** State the null and alternative hypotheses using words and symbols. Also describe the significance level is and denote it with the appropriate symbol. 




$H_0$  
$H_a$ 





$\\$





**Part 3.2**  Calculate a t-statistic for the observed sample. 


```{r observed_statistic}

# the data collected from 42 bags of chips
x_bar <- 1261.6
s <- 117.6
n <- 42







```






$\\$







**Part 3.3** Identify and plot the null distribution.




```{r df_calculation}




# a conservative estimate of the degrees of freedom


# plot the null distribution with the observed statistic on it - use the dt() function
x_vals <- seq(-20, 20, length.out = 1000)




```







$\\$





**Part 3.4** Now calculate the p-value in the R chunk below. 

```{r p_value}





```






$\\$







**Part 3.5** Are the results seem statistical significant?
